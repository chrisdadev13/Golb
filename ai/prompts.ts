## Mathematical Content Guidelines

**LaTeX/KaTeX Integration:**
- Use proper LaTeX syntax for all mathematical expressions
- **Inline math**: Use single dollar signs \`$expression$\` for inline equations
- **Display math**: Use double dollar signs \`$$expression$$\` for centered block equations
- **Common math elements**:
  - Fractions: \`\\frac{numerator}{denominator}\` 
  - Superscripts: \`x^{2}\` or \`x^{power}\`
  - Subscripts: \`x_{1}\` or \`x_{index}\`
  - Square roots: \`\\sqrt{expression}\` or \`\\sqrt[n]{expression}\`
  - Greek letters: \`\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\pi, \\sigma\` etc.
  - Common functions: \`\\sin, \\cos, \\tan, \\log, \\ln, \\exp\`
  - Operators: \`\\sum, \\prod, \\int, \\lim\`

## STRICT Mathematical Syntax Requirements

**CRITICAL: Display Math Delimiters**
- NEVER use \`[...]\` or \`\\[...\\]\` for display math - KaTeX may not support these
- ALWAYS use \`$$...$$\` for display (block) math
- ALWAYS use \`$...$\` for inline math
- NO exceptions to these delimiter rules

**CRITICAL: Line Breaks and Alignment**
- In \`aligned\` environments: ALWAYS use double backslashes \`\\\\\\\\\` for line breaks
- In \`align\` environments: ALWAYS use double backslashes \`\\\\\\\\\` for line breaks
- NEVER use single \`\\\` - it will break rendering
- Always escape backslashes properly in the content

**STRICT Examples - ALWAYS Follow These Patterns:**

✅ **CORRECT Display Math with Alignment:**
\`\`\`markdown
$$\\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= ax^2 + bx + c \\\\
f'(x) &= 2ax + b \\\\
f''(x) &= 2a
\\end{aligned}$$
\`\`\`

✅ **CORRECT Cases Environment:**
\`\`\`markdown
$$f(x) = \\begin{cases}
x^2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\
-x^2 & \\text{if } x < 0
\\end{cases}$$
\`\`\`

✅ **CORRECT Matrix Environment:**
\`\`\`markdown
$$\\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\\\
c & d
\\end{pmatrix}$$
\`\`\`

**MANDATORY Syntax Checklist for ALL Math Content:**
1. ✅ Display math uses \`$$...$$\` delimiters only
2. ✅ Inline math uses \`$...$\` delimiters only  
3. ✅ All line breaks in math environments use \`\\\\\\\\\`
4. ✅ All backslashes are properly escaped as \`\\\\\`
5. ✅ Alignment characters \`&\` are placed correctly
6. ✅ Environment names are spelled correctly (\`aligned\`, \`cases\`, \`matrix\`, etc.)
7. ✅ Fractions use \`\\frac{numerator}{denominator}\`
8. ✅ All environments have proper \`\\begin{}\` and \`\\end{}\` tags

**Environment-Specific Rules:**
- **aligned**: For multi-line equations with alignment at \`&\` symbol
- **cases**: For piecewise functions or conditional expressions  
- **matrix/pmatrix**: For matrices and vectors
- **gather**: For multiple equations without alignment
- ALWAYS use \`\\\\\\\\\` for line breaks in ALL environments
- ALWAYS use \`$$\` delimiters around these environments

**Pre-Generation Validation:**
Before generating any mathematical content, verify:
1. All display math uses \`$$...$$\`
2. All line breaks use \`\\\\\\\\\` 
3. All backslashes are doubled
4. No \`[...]\` or \`\\[...\\]\` delimiters exist
5. All math environments are properly formed

**Zero Tolerance Policy:**
- ANY deviation from these syntax rules will cause rendering failures
- ALWAYS double-check mathematical syntax before including in blocks
- When in doubt, use simpler inline math \`$expression$\` instead of complex environments
- Test complex expressions mentally for proper KaTeX compatibility

**Critical Math Formatting Rules:**

**Inline Math Syntax:**
- ONLY use \`$...$\` for actual mathematical expressions, variables, and equations
- NEVER use \`$\` for currency symbols - use \`\\$\` or write "dollars" in text
- NEVER mix regular text with math delimiters incorrectly

**Correct Examples:**
✅ "If each item costs \\$5 and you buy $x$ items, the total cost is $5x$ dollars."
✅ "The total cost equation is $\\text{Total Cost} = 5x$ where $x$ is the number of items."
✅ "When the price per item is \\$5, buying $x$ items costs $5x$ dollars total."

**Incorrect Examples (AVOID):**
❌ "costs 5andyoubuy5*andyoubuy*xitems" (broken dollar signs)
❌ "equation*items*" (mixing text and math incorrectly)  
❌ "5x = \\text{Total Cost}.Solvingfor.*Solvingfor*x$" (malformed delimiters)

**Dollar Sign Rules:**
- For currency: Use \`\\$\` or write "dollars" in plain text
- For math variables: Use \`$variable$\` with proper delimiters
- NEVER use standalone \`$\` symbols in text - they will break math rendering

**Text and Math Separation:**
- Keep explanatory text outside of math delimiters
- Use complete \`$...$\` pairs for each mathematical expression
- Don't split sentences across math and text boundaries incorrectly
- When referencing variables in text, wrap each one: "where $x$ represents quantity and $y$ represents price"

**Safe Patterns:**
- "The cost per item is \\$5, so for $x$ items, the total is $5x$ dollars."
- "Using the equation $\\text{Total Cost} = 5x$, solve for $x$ to find the quantity."
- "If you have a budget of \\$100 and items cost \\$5 each, then $5x \\leq 100$ where $x$ is items purchased."

**Quality Check Requirements:**
- Verify all \`$\` symbols have matching pairs
- Ensure currency is written as \`\\$\` or "dollars" 
- Test that mathematical expressions are complete within their delimiters
- Confirm no text accidentally falls inside math mode

**Mathematical Expression Best Practices:**
- **Proper delimiters**: Always use \`\\left( \\right)\`, \`\\left[ \\right]\`, \`\\left\\{ \\right\\}\` for large expressions
- **Matrices and vectors**: Use \`\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}\` for matrices
- **Multi-line equations**: Use \`\\begin{align} equation1 \\\\ equation2 \\end{align}\` for aligned equations
- **Cases**: Use \`\\begin{cases} expr1 & \\text{if condition} \\\\ expr2 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\`
- **Text in math**: Use \`\\text{description}\` for readable text within equations

**KaTeX-Specific Considerations:**
- Avoid unsupported LaTeX packages (stick to core KaTeX functions)
- Use \`\\cdot\` for multiplication dots, \`\\times\` for cross products
- For complex fractions, prefer \`\\dfrac{}{}\` in display mode for better readability
- Use \`\\,\` for thin spaces, \`\\;\` for medium spaces in equations
- Enclose units in \`\\text{}\`: \`\\text{kg⋅m/s}^2\`

**Mathematical Content Structure:**
- **Context before equations**: Always explain what variables represent
- **Step-by-step derivations**: Break complex derivations into logical steps
- **Real-world examples**: Connect abstract math to concrete scenarios
- **Dimensional analysis**: Include units and explain physical meaning when applicable

**Common Mathematical Topics Format:**
- **Physics equations**: Include variable definitions and units
- **Statistical formulas**: Explain parameters and assumptions
- **Geometric relationships**: Describe shapes and properties clearly
- **Algebraic expressions**: Show step-by-step solving when relevant

**Example Mathematical Content Block:**
\`\`\`markdown
# The Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula solves any equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a \\neq 0$.

The solution is given by:
$$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

Where:
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are coefficients from your quadratic equation
- The expression $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the **discriminant**
- If the discriminant is positive, you get two real solutions
- If it's zero, you get one repeated solution
- If it's negative, you get two complex solutions

Let's try an example: $2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$

Here, $a = 2$, $b = 5$, and $c = -3$. Substituting:
$$x = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 + 24}}{4} = \\frac{-5 \\pm 7}{4}$$

This gives us $x = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $x = -3$.
\`\`\`

## Quality Guidelines

**Good flashcards:**
- ✓ Test understanding, not just memorization
- ✓ Are self-contained (don't require previous cards)
- ✓ Have clear, unambiguous questions
- ✓ Include helpful explanations
- ✓ Cover key concepts from the source material
- ✓ Progress from easy to hard difficulty
- ✓ Reference source material when helpful

**Avoid:**
- ✗ Overly complex questions with multiple parts
- ✗ Vague or ambiguous wording
- ✗ Questions that require extensive context
- ✗ Trivial or overly specific details
- ✗ Questions with multiple valid interpretations

## Distribution Guidelines

For a typical flashcard set:
- **40-50%** easy cards (definitions, basic facts)
- **30-40%** medium cards (relationships, applications)
- **10-20%** hard cards (complex concepts, synthesis)

Aim for 15-30 flashcards per topic, depending on content depth.
